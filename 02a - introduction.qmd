# Introduction

## Purpose and Scope

The Strategic Technology Readiness for Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (STREAM) provides a structured approach for environmental consultancies to assess and improve their data management capabilities. This framework addresses the unique data challenges faced by the industry, such as field data collection, scientific data integrity, compliance reporting, and environmental monitoring.

## Industry Context

Environmental consultancies in Australia operate within a complex regulatory landscape and handle diverse data types including spatial, temporal, scientific, and compliance information. The framework acknowledges these complexities while providing practical guidance for organizations with limited resources.

## Benefits of Data Maturity

Improved data maturity delivers tangible benefits to environmental consultancies:

- Enhanced data quality and reliability for scientific and regulatory purposes
- Streamlined reporting for compliance with Australian environmental regulations
- Improved efficiency in field data collection and processing
- Better cross-project data integration and reuse
- Reduced operational risk and enhanced decision-making
- Competitive advantage through data-driven insights
