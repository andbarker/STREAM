## About This Framework

The Strategic Technology Readiness for Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (STREAM) provides a focussed approach for environmental consultancies to assess and improve their data management capabilities. Specifically designed for small to medium Australian firms, this framework addresses the unique challenges of environmental consulting, including field data collection, scientific data integrity, compliance reporting, and environmental monitoring.

## Why Data Maturity Matters

Environmental consultancies operate in a data-intensive industry where the quality, reliability, and accessibility of data directly impact business success. As regulatory requirements become more stringent and clients demand greater insights, effective data management has evolved from an operational concern to a strategic imperative.

- Streamlined regulatory compliance and reporting
- Improved operational efficiency and project delivery
- Reduced risk of data quality issues and rework
- Competitive advantage through data-driven insights
- Greater client confidence in deliverables

## How to Use This Webbook

This webbook contains the complete AECDMF framework, implementation guidance, and supporting materials. Navigate through the following sections to explore the framework:

1. [Executive Summary](01 executive-summary.qmd)
2. [Framework Report](02a - introduction.qmd)
3. [Assessment Questionnaires](app A assessment-questionnaires.qmd)
4. [Implementation Templates](app B implementation-templates.md)
5. [Regulatory Reference Guide](app C regulatory-reference.md)
6. [Case Studies](app D case-studies.md)
7. [Field Data Collection Template](app E field-data-template.md)

## Getting Started

We recommend beginning with the [Executive Summary](01 executive-summary.qmd) to understand the AECDMF approach and benefits. Then proceed to the [Framework Report](02a - introduction.qmd) for a comprehensive overview of the framework structure and methodology. The [Assessment Questionnaires](app A assessment-questionnaires.qmd) will help you conduct your initial maturity evaluation.
