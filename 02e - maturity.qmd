# Maturity Levels

Each dimension in the framework is assessed against five maturity levels, providing a clear progression path:

## Level 1: Initial (Basic)

**Characteristics**:

- Ad hoc, reactive data management
- Limited documentation or standardization
- Inconsistent practices across projects
- Minimal governance or quality controls

**Example Indicator** 

- *Field Data Collection & Quality*: Field data is collected using varying methods and forms with no standardized approach. Data validation happens informally, if at all. Quality issues are addressed reactively when problems arise.

## Level 2: Developing (Operational)

**Characteristics**:

- Basic processes documented
- Inconsistent implementation
- Limited governance with unclear accountability
- Reactive quality management

**Example Indicator** 

- *Field Data Collection & Quality*: Standard templates exist for field data collection, but usage is inconsistent. Basic validation checks are performed, but process varies by team. Quality issues are identified but tracking is limited.

## Level 3: Defined (Structured)

**Characteristics**:

- Standardized processes implemented organization-wide
- Defined governance structure with clear roles
- Proactive quality management
- Documented data standards

**Example Indicator** 

- *Field Data Collection & Quality*: Standardized field collection methods are consistently used across the organization. Formal validation processes are in place with regular quality checks. Issues are tracked and addressed systematically.

## Level 4: Managed (Analytical)

**Characteristics**:

- Quantitative management of data processes
- Performance metrics established and monitored
- Continuous improvement mechanisms
- Integrated governance across functions

**Example Indicator** 

- *Field Data Collection & Quality*: Field data collection includes automated validation and quality checks. Quality metrics are tracked and analyzed for trends. Continuous improvement processes address root causes of quality issues.

## Level 5: Optimizing (Innovative)

**Characteristics**:

- Data-driven decision making embedded in culture
- Predictive quality management
- Innovative approaches to data utilization
- Industry leadership in data management practices

**Example Indicator** 

- *Field Data Collection & Quality*: Advanced field data collection technologies optimize quality and efficiency. Predictive analytics identify potential quality issues before they occur. The organization contributes to industry standards for environmental data collection.
